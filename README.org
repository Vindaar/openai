* OpenAI API

Just another simple library to interface with OpenAI's API.

Does not support streaming or anything fancy.

You can either pass the API key directly as a string or read it from
your ~.authinfo.gpg~ file, if you store it that way.
#+begin_src nim
let client = newOpenAIClient(apiKey, "MainAPIKey")
let response = client.completion("You are a helpful assistant.", "Hello, how are you?")
echo response
#+end_src

For the latter:
#+begin_src nim
let decryptedContent = decryptFile("/home/foobar/.authinfo.gpg")
let apiKey = extractAPIKey(decryptedContent)
#+end_src

But feel free to do it in any other way. :)

You can turn the response into a typed object:
#+begin_src nim
let resOb = response.to(OpenAIResponse)
#+end_src
which may be more convenient to work with.

~completion~ is the only actual function of interest for usage. Adding
other parts of the API would be trivial of course. We default to
~gpt-4o-mini~, a temperature of 0 and ~8192~ max output tokens (the
max).
